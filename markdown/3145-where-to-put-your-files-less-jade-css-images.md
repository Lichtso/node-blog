Inside node-blog is a `public/` folder included, all files in here will be available for public access! Thanks to [node-kickstart](http://semu.mp/node-kickstart.html) all LESS files saved in `public/styles/` will be watched for changes new minifies CSS files will be generated whenever needed. 

**Jade Templates** in `views/`

**LESS Stylesheets** in `public/styles/`

**Markdown Articles** in `markdown/`

Apart from these three locations feel free to store your files whereever you want. Keep in mind all files below `public/` are public :)
